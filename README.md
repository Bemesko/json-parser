# JSON Parser

- This is a weekend project that I made based on this template: [Coding Challenges - JSON Parser](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser)

## Relevant Links

- [RFC 8259 - Actual JSON specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/std90)
- [Visual JSON specification from JSON.org](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)

## Checklist

### Step 0

- [X] Create repository
- [X] Download dependencies for testing, linting, etc
- [X] Download JSON test data from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vthtr4897fkuhw8/tests.zip?dl=0)

### Step 1

- [ ] Differentiate a simple `{}` JSON object from an invalid file
  - [ ] Lexer
    - [ ] Define tokens for `{` and `}`
  - [ ] Parser
    - [ ] Only allow opening brackets with corresponding closing brackets
- [ ] Return exit code 0 for succcess and 1 for failure
- [ ] Automate test cases

(I'll be putting more steps here as I go along)
